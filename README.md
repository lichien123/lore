# Lore
### **Description**

Lore is a a physical fitness RPG application that rewards users with a level up system. It streamlines workout, cardio and stretching routines for users and makes it easier for them to train towards specific traits such as speed, strength and stamina.

### Motivation

Recognizing the negative perceptions often associated with workout culture, Lore aims to be a more inclusive approach to staying fit. By creating an RPG themed fitness quest, we make working out more approachable for everyday individuals, by making it as fun as playing a video game. Accessibility is important to us, we included track options for those who face mobility constraints, but still want to grow and maintain areas like strength and stamin.

### Code Style

Object Oriented Coding.

### How to Use

1. <u>Landing page</u>: Lists all track options.
2. <u>Sign Up/Login:</u> Users can only see each track's details once they are logged in. Once a user clicks a track, they will be prompted to either sign up or login.
   1. On sign up, the user's information is posted to the Lore database.
3. <u>Track's Page:</u> Each track page is populated via the Lore API, dynamically, on page load. At the top of each track page, there is a points tab, which shows the user their the points that they have earned.
4. Our project is deployed here: https://radiant-headland-41548.herokuapp.com/

### Key Technologies Used

- Node.js — application's main server.
- Express.js — pages routes (GET and POST).
- Sequelize — Dynamically created Tracks table and User Info table.
- MySQL — Passport.js data.
- Uranium.js — Tabs feature on track page (UI).
- Bootstrap — bare bones page skeleton.
- jQuery — All events and dynamic HTML elements.
- Passport.js — Registration and Login.

### **Key Features**

- Database that tracks registration and a user's selected track
- Personalized workout API for each archetype track (Titan, Hunter, Assasin)
- Level Up feature that allows user's to graduate to a new track once they meet their fitness goals.

### Code Example

Here is how we accessed data in our homemade API, and parsed it out to our client-side code.

```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {

  console.log("Assasin Page Loaded.");

  var queryURL = "/api/tracks";
    $.ajax({
      url: queryURL,
      method: "GET"
    }).done(function(Track) {

  $("#track-name").html(Track[0].track_name);
  $("#track-desc").html(Track[0].track_description);
  $("#stretch-vid").html(Track[0].stretch_vid);
  $("#cardio-vid").html(Track[0].cardio_vid);
  $("#workout-vid").html(Track[0].workout_vid);

	})

});
```
